# Onitama Bot "Angsthaas"

Competition bot for Onitama as per [jorikvdwerf/Onitama.Starterbot.DotnetCore](https://github.com/jorikvdwerf/Onitama.Starterbot.DotnetCore) instructions.

## Getting started

Make sure to create an `apikey.txt` file in the main project folder root.
If you don't, the solution won't build.
If you do, it won't be committed to git because it's in the `.gitignore` file.

Please refer to [the starter bot](https://github.com/jorikvdwerf/Onitama.Starterbot.DotnetCore) for more details about the Onitama competition.
This repo merely contains a small (not-so-competitive) bot to enter the competition.

## About the "Angsthaas" bot

Most entries in the competition will likely try to _win_.
This bot however tries very hard _not to loose_.
As such, it should be interesting competition and training material for others.
